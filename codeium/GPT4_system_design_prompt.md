Sure! Here's a refined and clearer version of your prompt:

I want to design a distributed system for local LLM (Large Language Model) services using HTTP. The system will have three major modules: Channel, core, and Helper.

1. **Channel Module**:
    - **Purpose**: Define a set of rules for different access methods (e.g., SMS, Email, phone call, instant message, files, images, audio, video).
    - **Functionality**: Each access method operates as a separate channel, like an individual web server.
    - **Process**: 
        - Receive data from a specific access method.
        - Convert the data to plain text to be used as a prompt.
        - Transfer the prompt, along with metadata (e.g., user info, channel type), to the core module.

2. **core Module**:
    - **Purpose**: Serve as the central processing unit of the system, powered by its own LLM.
    - **Functionality**:
        - Accept prompts and additional data (such as images and videos) from the Channel module.
        - Store the prompts and manage chat sessions for each user.
        - Generate responses using the LLM and send them back to the corresponding Channel if possible.
        - If the task requires additional capabilities, delegate it to the Helper module.

3. **Helper Module**:
    - **Purpose**: Provide additional capabilities and services that can be leveraged by the core.
    - **Functionality**:
        - Register with the core, providing metadata such as capabilities, input/output formats, and access methods via HTTP.
        - Allow third parties to implement their own Helpers, which can be used by the core.
        - Helpers can also be implemented by third parties.

**System Requirements**:
- All modules (Channel, core, and Helper) should be easily startable and restartable.
- The system should handle module failures gracefully and allow for easy restarts.
